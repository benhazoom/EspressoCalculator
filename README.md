# :coffee: EspressoCalculator

This program utilizes information about espresso making for helping the beginner espresso maker by giving him tips and proper adjustments for making the perfect espresso shot. It's main logic is to figure if the espresso flow was to 'Fast' (lower then 100 score) or to 'Slow' (higher then 100 score) 

By analyzing the user information inputted the application suggests (if needed) specific tips relating to the specific factor which made the anomaly from the “golden ratio” for making perfect textbook espresso shot.

There are 6 factors examined 
1. Basket type – (single/double/triple)
2. Amount of coffee brewed
3. Grind size
4. Brewing time
5. Output weight
6. Brewing pressure

For each factor there is a guideline and there are more recommendation about the equipment required and the process itself in the tips section accessed by show/hide tips button

The program also teaches to use a timer and a kitchen scale for espresso making which are important for consistency and precision. It might not be as useful for the experienced barista but it is very useful for a beginner.
