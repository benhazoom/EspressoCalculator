# :coffee: EspressoCalculator

This program utilizes information about espresso making for helping the beginner espresso maker by giving him tips and proper adjustments for making the perfect espresso shot. It's main logic is to figure if the espresso flow was to 'Fast' or to 'Slow' and suggesting to change grinding size if the weight of the coffee applied was the same as the suggested amount. If not it suggests changing the amount of coffee applied for the suggested amount. The program also teaches to use a timer and a kitchen scale for espresso making which are important for consistency and precision. It might not be as useful for the experienced barista but it is very useful for a beginner.
